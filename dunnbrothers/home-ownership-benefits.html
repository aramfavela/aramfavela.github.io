    Regardless if you’re a first time buyer, relocating, or a move-up buyer, buying a home is one of the
biggest decisions both financially and emotionally, you will make in a lifetime. For a first time buyer, 
you’re probably ecstatic to own your own home. However, all the different steps and procedures can be 
a bit overwhelming. For the experienced buyer, it never hurts to get a quick refresher course. <br><br>
A vast majority of American (87%) say the number one criterion for defining the “good life” owning a 
home, according to the National Association of Realtors.  So what are the benefits of owning a home? <br><br>Owning a home provides a strong sense of security, the ability to control your environment, and is the 
place you have friends and family over for that special occasion.  Another advantage to owning your 
home the financial security of knowing your mortgage is fixed or capped monthly. When renting, you 
are constantly have to be worried about annual increases or a letter from the landlord letting you know 
he has decided to take his property in a different direction. <br><br>
Homeownership is also the primary component when creating wealth for many Americans according to 
Harvard University. Over the years as you pay down your mortgage you are creating an increasing 
interest in your property. As you build this equity over the years and your home most likely appreciates 
this can become a source of income. Owning a home also provides options that renters don’t have such 
as home equity loans or how equity conversion mortgages. Not to mention one of the biggest tax credits 
for most Americans is the interest on their mortgage! <br><br>
Over the years, your home likely will be the best investment you'll ever make. But more importantly, it 
will be the place that offers you and your family shelter, security and stability. It tough to ask for a better return on investment than that!
