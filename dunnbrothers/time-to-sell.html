   It is time to sell your home! Perhaps you have to relocate for work or want to downsize because you
getting ready to retire or your kids are off to college. On the opposite side of the spectrum you just had 
your first child and need to upgrade to a larger house or need that extra room for a home office. 
Whatever the case may is let Dunn Brothers Real Estate help you by providing information about current 
market conditions, neighborhood statistics, determining a realistic sales price, and lots more.
<br><br>
When it comes to selling your home always keep in mind that your house is only worth a qualified buyer 
is willing to pay and to have realistic expectations. Also, to keep in mind is the current state of the realestate market. Depending on quantity and quality of homes on the market can greatly affect the sales 
price of your home.
<br><br>
Another issue to keep in when selling a home are the tax implications you may come across. These 
issues include whether you purchased the home or inherited it, if you used your home for business or 
rental purposes, costs associated with selling your home, and any home improvements and additions 
that you've undertaken.
<br><br>
The Federal Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provides capital gains tax exclusions of up to $500,000 for 
married taxpayers filing jointly and $250,000 for single taxpayers or married taxpayers filing separately. 
Current capital gains rates are 20 percent for those in upper tax brackets and 10 percent for those in 
lower tax brackets. Overall capital gains rates have been lowered even further — to 18 percent and 8 
percent respectively — for assets acquired after December 31, 2000, and held five years or more.
<br><br>
In order to qualify for this tax exemptions you must have used the home as your primary residence and 
have lived there for at least two of the last five years. Also, the two years do not need to be consecutive 
There are special circumstances where you may be able to qualify for the exception without meeting 
these requirements such as relocating for a job. Additionally, this is not a one-time exception and you 
are eligible for the exception once every two year as long as you meet the qualifications.  If you sell the 
inherited home for a profit, you're required to pay federal and state taxes on the gain. If you keep the 
house as a second residence and/or eventually move into it after renting it to tenants, you may take the 
$250,000/$500,000 capital gains tax exclusion if you meet the requirements. When you're deciding what 
to do with inherited property, you should consider the current estate tax laws and basis practices. 
Whatever your case may be we are here to help and can guide you to a tax professional.
<br><br>
When you are getting ready to sell your home it is also a good idea to talk to a lender in advance to 
know you’re price range before finding a new home. This will help both of us find and set more accurate 
parameters for your new home. It is obviously not a wise decision to start looking for a house before you 
know what yours is worth and before you have it up on the market. Having your home sell at the right 
time will help eliminate the interim time in between moves and any unnecessary cost that you would 
have otherwise incurred.
