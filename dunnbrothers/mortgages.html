	<p class="buyers-text">
    With new additional restriction in lending due to the many subprime loans it has become increasingly 
more difficult to get approved for a loan. Fortunately, interest rates are nearing historically low interest rates. This makes owning a home easier now than ever. However, with a loan there is more cost than just the interest alone. <br><br>
Points are often associated with the cost of lending money. A point is a form of prepaid interest and 
translates mathematically to one percent. Lenders may charge you points upon the close to cover 
discount points and lender fees. Another option is the ability to pay discount points in exchange for 
lowering your monthly payment.  Lenders may also charge points based on poor ratios or credit 
worthiness. <br><br>
Getting preapproved or prequalified improves your chances of having your offer accepted because it 
shows that you are a serious buyer. During this time a lender will collect a number of documents such as 
paystubs, W-2’s, 1040 Tax Returns, bank statements, and identification like a driver’s license and social 
security card. After analyzing these documents and scrutinizing your credit and debt information they 
will provide you with a written letter on an approved loan amount. <br><br>
If you fit certain criteria you can qualify for specialty loans. For instance, first time home buyers have 
several programs that offer loan assistant options. One of these is an FHA loan. These sorts of loans are 
government backed loans that are designed to help qualified buyers who can’t afford a down payment. 
This loan is extremely popular and provides up to 97% financing but comes with the cost of premium 
mortgage insurance and strict credit requirements. This is just one of many programs that lenders have 
to offer so don’t hold back and think that you won’t be able to qualify.  In addition to first time buyer 
programs, there are also veteran loans known as VA loans that can offer low to no-down payment 
options. We can help determine which loan best fits your financials needs whether it is a local, state, 
federal or standard conventional loan.
