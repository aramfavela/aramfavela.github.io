    Buying a house begins with the residential purchase contract. We are here to help you review this 
complicated part of the transaction process. The offer begins with a written proposal spelling out your 
price and any stipulations regarding the purchase. Offers, in some cases can have contingences attached 
to them. For instance, if you are selling your current home and want to make an offer on the home you 
found there are options like making the deal contingent on the sale of your current home.
<br><br>
	The residential purchase agreement contains all the terms of the deal, including sales price, deposit,
closing date, disclosure requirements, inspections, and fees agreed upon by both parties. Other 
provisions also are included, such as the buyer's final inspection and the method by which all real estate 
taxes and other bills will be pro-rated between buyer and seller.
<br><br>
	Once submitted to the seller, the individual is given time to review all the offers. Often times there will be a counter and a negotiation process to follow. Once the terms are finalized you will start facing some of the initial upfront fees. In conjunction with the purchase contract you will submit your deposit. 
Generally these deposits range anywhere from 1-5% but could theoretically be as much as the purchase 
price of the house. If the deal is completed the deposit will serve as a portion of the down payment. If 
the deal falls through the deposit is typically returned if it is the cause of contractual or legal reason. However, the seller may be entitled to keep the deposit for other reasons.
<br><br>
	Following the initial upfront fees and contract will be a series of disclosures and deadlines to meet.
Some of these deadlines include walkthroughs, appraisals, buyer and seller disclosures, and home 
inspections. Home inspections serve as a tool to help protect the buyer and often times vary greatly.  
Some check the home's structure, construction and mechanical systems, and appliances, which may be 
transferred with the property. Regardless of the home inspector this serves as good tool to become 
informed of the necessary repairs of the home. Your realtor at this point can assist you by creating a 
repairs list and negotiating the terms with the seller.
<br><br>
	According to HUD, an inspector typically checks the electrical system, plumbing and waste disposal, the water heater, insulation and ventilation, the HVAC system, water source and quality, ceilings, walls, 
floors, and roof. Usually conducted around the same time is the appraisal.
<br><br>
	Whereas the home inspection serves as a form of protection for the buyer the appraisal is there to 
protect the lender interest. Appraisals are conducted by trained professionals who base value on factors 
such as location, size of land, and the condition of the home. Recent sales within the past year and no 
further than a mile are often used to support the determined value.
<br><br>
	Nearing the end of the deal you will finally approach closing day. This is when ownership is transferred from the seller to you! At this point in time you will receive loads of different legal documentation that you will have review and sign and also when you will pay the rest of your down payment and closing cost. In addition, there is other item that will need to complete before the house closes such as final approval of your mortgage terms and conditions, clearing title, appraising the property and recording the deed.
<br><br>
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act also known as RESPA has taken steps to protect buyers
before, during and after closing. You are entitled to receiving a preliminary copy of the HUD-1 
settlement statement which will list all the estimated closing cost that you will be expected to pay. Also, if you request the final HUD-1 one day (24-hours) prior to closing you will know exactly what you have to 
pay out of pocket. Also a requisite with the closing process is the Escrow Settlement Statement which 
will be given to you at closing or within 45 days of closing. This details the estimated taxes, insurance 
premiums, and other charges that must be paid from the escrow account during the first year of the 
loan.
<br><br>
Within three days of your loan application being received the lender by law must send you a good faith
estimate outlining closing cost along with a copy of the HUD publication Settlement Costs: A HUD Guide. 
This will help you understand to and explain what sorts of cost are to come. Typically, closing cost 
include escrow fees, property taxes, interest, loan origination fees, recording fees, survey fees, first 
premium of mortgage insurance, title insurance, loan discount points, first payment to escrow account, 
paid receipt for homeowner's insurance policy, and any documentation preparation fees. Generally this 
is about 3-7% of the sales price.
