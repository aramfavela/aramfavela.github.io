		<h2 class="dark-text">Debt Collection Violations</h2>
		<p>When you first get the news that you are being pursued by a debt collector in collections, a lawsuit or a post-judgment scenario such as garnishment, your instinct might be to panic.
		Seeking our advice will go a long way to helping you process the information and learn what if any next actions you can take to protect yourself, your family, and your assets.
		There are proper legal defenses consumers can make to a debt collector's efforts to collect money against you. We can show you what your defenses are.</p>
     
    <h3>Here's Three Examples of How to Defeat a Lawsuit</h3>
   	<div class="statue-of-limitations">
    	<h4> <strong> 1.) Statue of Limitations </strong></h4>
    	<img src="images/services/statue.jpg" alt="statue of limitations image">
    	<p> Debt collectors only have a certain number of years in which to bring a lawsuit. This limitations of time is known as the "statute of limitations," because governments pass laws or statutes that indicate the length of time in which a suit must be brought. 
    	<br>
    	Believe it or not, debt collectors can and do bring lawsuits against alleged debtors past the statute of limitations. This happens more often than you think. We can help you determine whether the lawsuit that was filed against you was filed past the applicable statute of limitations.
   	</p>
   </div>
   <h4> <strong> 2.) Improper Service </strong></h4>
    <img src="images/services/improper.jpg" alt="improper service image">
    <p> Once a debt collector has committed to file a lawsuit against you, the courts have determined that they must either (1) serve a copy of the lawsuit upon you personally, (2) serve someone at your true residence of suitable age, or (3) serve by publication after they have tried without success to serve you personally. Typically, the courts give the debt collector 120 days in which to find you and serve you. Most debt collectors hire full-time process servers to personally serve you.
    <br>
    Several mistakes or intentional acts are sometimes committed wherein a default judgment is made against you without your knowledge. Failure to actually serve the lawsuit, or misrepresentations by the process server that the lawsuit was served when in fact it was not, is often referred to as "sewer service." We have uncovered fact patterns where the lawsuit was not properly served within the 120 days period. Improper service can be grounds to set aside or void a judgment against you.
   </p>
   <h4> <strong> 3.) Inadmissible Evidence </strong></h4>
   <div class="inadmissible-evidence">
    <img src="images/services/evidence.jpg" alt="inadmissible evidence image">
    <p> Lawsuits are based on evidence. But you don't defend yourself, the debt collector wins by default.
Not all evidence is admissible, but someone needs to be there to object to evidence that is inadmissible.
It's important that you answer the complaint and then evaluate the evidence that they intend to use in court. Not all evidence is admissible in evidence.

<!-- CREDIT REPORT ERRORS -->

	<div id="credit-violations"></div>
	<h2 class="dark-text">Credit Report Errors</h2>
    <p>Credit scores have a profound impact on our lives. It controls our access to money, and what we pay to use money (interest rates and fees). As credit scoring systems began to rapidly grow in the 1960's with the advent of computers and their ability to store and share information, the United States Congress passed laws in 1970 to protect you from mistakes and abuses. Known as the Fair Credit Reporting Act or "FCRA," these laws are designed to protect you (a) from other people's access to this information, and (b) your right and ability to request corrections and deletions from mistakes on your reports.
The FCRA not only requires that credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax and Transunion) to perform a reasonable reinvestigation but also make corrections in a timely manner.  Unfortunately, credit reporting agencies do not always perform their roles properly. Furnishers (creditors and debt collectors) can also fail to conduct a proper reinvestigation. </p>
    <h3>Here are three common types of errors occur within a person's credit reports</h3>
    	<h4> <strong> 1.) Identity Theft </strong></h4>
    	<p> Debt collectors only have a certain number of years in which to bring a lawsuit. This limitations of time is known as the "statute of limitations," because governments pass laws or statutes that indicate the length of time in which a suit must be brought.

    	Believe it or not, debt collectors can and do bring lawsuits against alleged debtors past the statute of limitations. This happens more often than you think. We can help you determine whether the lawsuit that was filed against you was filed past the applicable statute of limitations.
   	</p>
   <h4> <strong> 2.) Mixed Information </strong></h4>
    <p> Once a debt collector has committed to file a lawsuit against you, the courts have determined that they must either (1) serve a copy of the lawsuit upon you personally, (2) serve someone at your true residence of suitable age, or (3) serve by publication after they have tried without success to serve you personally. Typically, the courts give the debt collector 120 days in which to find you and serve you. Most debt collectors hire full-time process servers to personally serve you.

We have uncovered fact patterns where the lawsuit was not properly served within the 120 days period. Improper service can be grounds to set aside or void a judgment against you.
   </p>
   <h4> <strong> 3.) Mislabeled Items </strong></h4>

<h3> <strong> What will a credit block/freeze do?</strong></h3>
<p> Also known as a security freeze, this tool lets you restrict access to your credit report, which in turn makes it more difficult for <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft"> identity thieves </a> to open new accounts in your name. That’s because most creditors need to see your credit report before they approve a new account. If they can’t see your file, they may not extend the credit.
<br>
<br>
<strong> Does a credit freeze affefct my <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0152-credit-scores">credit score?</a> <br> </strong>
No, a credit freeze does not affect your credit score.
 A credit freeze also does not:</p>
	<ul>
     	<li> Prevent you from getting your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/lisa/153274bafcc64a1e"> free annual credit report</a> </li>
        <li> Keep you from opening a new account, applying for a job, renting an apartment, or buying insurance. But if you’re doing any of these, you’ll need to lift the freeze temporarily, either for a specific time or for a specific party, say, a potential landlord or employer. The cost and lead times to lift a freeze vary, so it’s best to check with the credit reporting company in advance. </li>
        <li> Prevent a thief from making charges to your existing accounts. You still need to monitor all bank, credit card and insurance statements for fraudulent transactions. </li>
   </ul> 
 <p>
 	<strong> Does a credit freeze stop prescreened credit offers? </strong><br><br>
    No. If you want to stop getting <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0148-prescreened-credit-and-insurance-offers"> prescreened offers of credit</a>, call 888-5OPTOUT (888-567-8688) or go <a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t"> </a>online. The phone number and website are operated by the nationwide credit reporting companies. You can opt out for five years or permanently. However, some companies send offers that are not based on prescreening, and your federal opt-out right will not stop those kinds of solicitations.
<br>
<br>
As you consider opting out, you should know that prescreened offers can provide many benefits, especially if you are in the market for a credit card or insurance. Prescreened offers can help you learn about what's available, compare costs, and find the best product for your needs. Because you are pre-selected to receive the offer, you can be turned down only under limited circumstances. The terms of prescreened offers also may be more favorable than those that are available to the general public. In fact, some credit card or insurance products may be available only through prescreened offers.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>Can anyone see my credit report if it is frozen?</strong><br>
 Certain entities still will have access to it.</p>
	<ul>
     	<li>Your report can be released to your existing creditors or to debt collectors acting on their behalf.</li>
        <li>Government agencies may have access in response to a court or administrative order, a subpoena, or a search warrant.</li>
   </ul>
 
 
 
 
<p> <strong>How do I lift a freeze?</strong><br>

A freeze remains in place until you ask the credit reporting company to temporarily lift it or remove it altogether. A credit reporting company must lift a freeze no later than three business days after getting your request. The cost to lift a freeze varies by state.

If you opt for a temporary lift because you are applying for credit or a job, and you can find out which credit reporting company the business will contact for your file, you can save some money by lifting the freeze only at that particular company.

<br>
<br>
<strong>What's the difference between a credit freeze and a fraud alert?</strong><br>
A credit freeze locks down your credit. A fraud alert allows creditors to get a copy of your credit report as long as they take steps to verify your identity. For example, if you provide a telephone number, the business must call you to verify whether you are the person making the credit request. Fraud alerts may be effective at stopping someone from opening new credit accounts in your name, but they may not prevent the misuse of your existing accounts. You still need to monitor all bank, credit card and insurance statements for fraudulent transactions.

Three types of fraud alerts are available:</p>


	<ul>
     	<li>  <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/lisa/153274bafcc64a1e"> Initial Fraud Alert</a>. If you're concerned about identity theft, but haven't yet become a victim, this fraud alert will protect your credit from unverified access for at least 90 days. You may want to place a fraud alert on your file if your wallet, Social Security card, or other personal, financial or account information are lost or stolen.</li>
     	<li><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0279-extended-fraud-alerts-and-credit-freezes">Extended Fraud Alert</a>. For victims of identity theft, an extended fraud alert will protect your credit for seven years.</li>
 	</ul>
